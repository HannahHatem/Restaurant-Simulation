# Restaurant-Simulation
## Project Description
A simulation program to manage cooks and orders, implemented using Data Structures and Algorithms. This system arranges orders according to arrival time and priority equation taking into consideration order size and money etc., it handles assigning orders to cooks as well as break handling taking into consideration cooks' speed and the probability a cook might get injured. This system is updated as time passes.
Restaurant simulation program using the concept of Data Structures in C++
